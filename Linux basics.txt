Linux :

Founder of Linux - Linus Torvalds

Linux is an open-source OS based on UNIX

Core part : kernel(Manages CPU, Memory, and devices)

Examples: Ubuntu, Kali Linux, Fedora, Red Hat, Debian, etc


Unix --->  UNIX is an old, powerful, and stable operating system that was first developed in the 1970s at AT&T Bell Labs.

It became the foundation for many modern operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and others.

Used in big servers (IBM, HP)

UNIX examples:

Solaris (by Sun Microsystems)

AIX (by IBM)

HP-UX (by Hewlett-Packard)

macOS (yes! macOS is UNIX certified)


UNIX = Original system
Linux = Free and modern version inspired by UNIX

Start with Commands

Basic Directory Structure

Every Linux system starts from / (root directory):

bin > Basic binaries (ls,cat, cp)
etc > configuration files
home > user files (like c:\Users)
root > root users home
var  >logs, cache
tmp > temporary files
usr > user-installed programs

File/Directory Navigation:

pwd > print current directory
ls > list files
ls -la > show hidden files
cs /home > go to /home
cd .. > go up one directory
cd ~ go to home directory

File Operations:

touch file.txt > create empty files
cp file1 file2 > copy file
mv file1 newname > rename/move
rm file.txt > remove file
mkdir test > create folder
rmdir text > remove empty folder
rm -r test > remove folder and also content 

Viewing Files:

cat file.txt >show file content 
less file.txt > scroll through file
head -n 5 file.txt show first 5 lines
tail -n 10 file.txt >show last 10 lines

User & Permission Management:

> User info:

whoami > show current user
id > show user ID info
sudo su > switch to root user

> Permissions:

Each file has : -rwxr-xr-- (owner,group, others)

r-read, w-write, x-execute

> Change permissions

chmod 755 file.sh
chmod u+x file.sh >add executed permissions to user

Process management

ps > list running processes
ps aux > detailed process list
top > show system usage in real time
kill 1234 > kill processwith PID 1234

Networking commands

ifconfig > show network interfaces(or ip a )
ping google.com > checks internet
netstat -tuln > show open ports
curl <url> fetch data from URL
wget <url> > download file

Package management:

For Debian/Ubuntu/Kali (APT)

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install nmap
sudo apt remove nmap

File searching & Text filters

find / -name file.txt >search files
grep "text" file.txt > search for text
grep -r "password" /etc > recursive search

Shell Scripting Basics

create a file:

nano hello.sh >  to nano shell save ctrl o , enter ctrl x

Add:

echo "Hello, Thrisha!"

Run: 

chmod +x hello.sh
./hello.sh

interview expected questions

What’s the difference between apt update and apt upgrade?

apt update - refreshes package list
apt upgrade - install new versions.

How to check disk usage?

df -h > disk usage
du -sh > folder sizes

How to check system info?

uname -a
lsb_release -a

What are runlevels?
System states (e.g., 0 = halt, 3 = multi-user, 5 = GUI).
