In cybersecurity, Nmap (Network Mapper) is used for network discovery, security auditing, and penetration testing. It's a free, open-source tool that can run on many operating systems. 
How Nmap is used 
Network discovery: Find IP addresses, operating systems, and services on a network
Security auditing: Identify vulnerabilities and security loopholes
Penetration testing: Discover security issues and vulnerabilities in a system
Network troubleshooting: Diagnose network issues and connectivity problems
Network inventory: Manage network assets and service upgrade schedules
Host monitoring: Monitor the uptime of hosts and services
How Nmap works
Nmap sends packets to target hosts and analyzes the responses to determine if ports are open, closed, or filtered. It can scan multiple hosts simultaneously. 
Nmap use cases
Nmap is used by network administrators, security professionals, and red and blue teams. 
Nmap risks
While Nmap can help protect your network, it can also be used to violate the law.
